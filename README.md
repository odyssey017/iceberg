# 📊 Order Placement Logic & Key Parameters

When placing orders, the bot follows a **systematic approach** based on the user's settings. Below is a breakdown of how **Edge, Min Order Size, Max Vig, and Increments** affect order placement and adjustment.

## 1️⃣ Edge (`% Edge Above Market`)
🔹 **Definition**: The "Edge" parameter defines how much better your order price (odds) should be compared to the current best available taker odds on your desired outcome.  
🔹 **Purpose**: Ensures your orders are always competitive and never stale.

### **Example Scenario:**
- Current **best taker odds**: `0.60` (implied probability of 60%)  
- You set **Edge** = `2%`  
- The bot **adjusts** your order's odds to:  

  ```
  Desired Taker Odds = Best Taker Odds × (1 - Edge / 100)
                     = 0.60 × (1 - 0.02)
                     = 0.588 (58.8% implied probability)
  ```

✅ **Your orders will be placed at a slightly better value than the current market to attract takers while maintaining profitability.**  

---

## 2️⃣ Min Order Size to Consider (`minOrderSize`)
🔹 **Definition**: The minimum size of orders (in USDC) that the bot will consider when assessing market conditions.  
🔹 **Purpose**: Avoids reacting to insignificant or "dust" orders that could distort decision-making.  

### **Example Scenario:**
- **Market Orders Available:**
  ```
  Order 1: 50 USDC (Odds: 0.62)
  Order 2: 200 USDC (Odds: 0.60)
  Order 3: 3000 USDC (Odds: 0.59)
  ```
- Your **Min Order Size = 100**  

✅ **Order 1 (50 USDC) will be ignored**, but **Orders 2 & 3 (≥100 USDC) will be used for decision-making.**  

---

## 3️⃣ Max Vig (`MaxVig`)
🔹 **Definition**: The maximum vig (overround) allowed for the market before the bot cancels/stops placing orders.  
🔹 **Purpose**: Protects against placing orders if the vig becomes too large.  

### **How Vig Is Calculated:**
- A 2-outcome market’s **vig** is determined by:  
  ```
  Vig = (Best Taker Odds Outcome 1) + (Best Taker Odds Outcome 2) - 1
  ```
- If **Vig > MaxVig**, orders are **not placed** or **canceled**.

### **Example Scenario:**
- **Best Taker Odds:**
  ```
  Outcome 1: 0.58
  Outcome 2: 0.45
  ```
- Vig Calculation:  
  ```
  0.58 + 0.45 - 1 = 0.03 (3% vig)
  ```
- Your **MaxVig = 2% (0.02)**  

🚨 **Since the actual Vig (3%) exceeds the allowed MaxVig (2%), the bot cancels active orders and does NOT place new ones.**  

---

## 4️⃣ Increments (`increments`)
🔹 **Definition**: The size of each individual order posted at a time.  
🔹 **Purpose**: Ensures controlled exposure by spreading orders over time instead of filling all at once.  

### **Example Scenario:**
- **Your Position Settings:**
  ```
  Max Fill: 1000 USDC
  Increments: 250 USDC
  ```
- The bot will **place orders in 250-unit increments** until the total filled volume reaches 1000 USDC.

⏳ **Order Flow:**  
```
1️⃣ Bot places 250 USDC ✅
2️⃣ Another 250 USDC ✅
3️⃣ Another 250 USDC ✅
4️⃣ Final 250 USDC ✅
🔄 Stops placing orders once 1000 USDC are filled.
```

✅ **This prevents executing all trades at once, giving time for better odds to emerge.**  

---

## ⏳ Order Placement Summary Flow  
1️⃣ **Bot checks the market** for valid orders (above `minOrderSize`).  
2️⃣ **Calculates vig** to ensure it is within `MaxVig`.  
3️⃣ **Finds best taker odds** and applies `Edge`.  
4️⃣ **Determines order size** based on `increments`.  
5️⃣ **Places orders** at the calculated best value.  
6️⃣ **Cancels orders** if market conditions change and no longer meet criteria.  

---

## ✅ Final Example of Order Execution  
### **Scenario:**  
- **You set**: `Edge = 2%`, `Min Order Size = 100`, `MaxVig = 2%`, `Increments = 500`.  
- **Market Data**:  
  ```
  Best Taker Odds Outcome 1: 0.60
  Best Taker Odds Outcome 2: 0.43
  ```
- **Bot Calculation:**  
  ```
  Desired Taker Odds = 0.60 × (1 - 0.02) = 0.588
  Vig = (0.60 + 0.43 - 1) = 0.03 (3%)
  ```
- **Action Taken**:  
  - 🚫 **No orders placed (Vig is too high)**  
  - If vig were **≤ 2%**, the bot would **post 500-unit orders at 0.588 odds**.

## 📜 Usage Guide

### **1️⃣ Build a Position**

- Increments for an individual order (size of the individual order posted)
- Your betting edge (
- Min order size to consider
- Max vig allowed

### **2️⃣ Manage Active Positions**
The bot continuously checks:
